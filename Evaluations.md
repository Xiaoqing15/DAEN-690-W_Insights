# Evaluation of Results of 3 Optimal Approaches

## Optimal Allocation 1 – General Analysis
The General Analysis approach undertaken in the project serves as a strategic initial step to optimize the allocation of BLS units across Fairfax County. The methodology began with the identification of the top 8 stations experiencing the highest response times. This identification process, illustrated in Figure 19, lays the groundwork for the analysis by pinpointing stations with critical needs. Intriguingly, the analysis revealed that among the top 20 geographical areas, 7 are frequented the most by the ambulances with the highest response times. Notably, station 420, which was expected to be among these areas, was absent. A deeper dive into the dispatch patterns of ambulance A420 showed that it primarily services the area of station 419, thus bringing station 419 into consideration for potential allocation due to its high demand.
The evaluation further led to the decision to retain the four current ambulances, anchored by the revelation that these units are situated within BLS incident hotspots—areas that consistently require substantial BLS support. This decision emphasizes the importance of situating BLS units in regions demonstrating high incident rates to ensure prompt emergency responses.

The graph indicates that the blue bars represent units that meet the benchmark, while the red bars indicate those that exceed it. The General Analysis method effectively aligns with the Fairfax County benchmark of 390 seconds for BLS unit response times. This strategy indicates that a broad, less targeted allocation can still enhance response efficiencies, potentially due to a more even distribution of units. It has informed the proposal of a strategic 20-station ambulance fleet based on holistic data analysis. Future refinements to this method, along with insights from the Partition Approach, could further optimize resource distribution to ensure rapid emergency services and resilient system operations.

In summary, the General Analysis method, with its focus on response times and incident hotspots, provides a solid foundation for enhancing BLS coverage. While the approach maintains a broad perspective, it has demonstrated effectiveness in identifying key areas for improved BLS unit distribution, as evidenced by the average response time of 371.89 seconds. The approach suggests that a broader strategy can form the basis for targeted and refined allocations, ensuring swift and equitable emergency medical responses throughout Fairfax County.

##	**Optimal Allocation 2 – Greedy Search**
The presented bar graph serves as a visual assessment for the second project goal, which is to determine optimal stations for converting an additional eight ambulances. The blue bars indicate units operating below the 390-second response time benchmark, thus showcasing effective current allocation. Conversely, the red bars represent units with response times exceeding the benchmark, highlighting areas where improvements are necessary.

Figure above illustrates the outcome after reallocating resources based on the greedy algorithm, with the intention to optimize the placement of additional ambulances. The new improved total average response time under greedy search allocation is 372.65 seconds and is below the benchmark response time of 390 seconds. Despite this reallocation, the red bars reveal that 5 units are still not meeting the benchmark response time of 390 seconds (6 and a half minutes). This suggests that while the allocation of additional ambulances has likely had a positive impact, it has not been sufficient to bring all units within the desired response time threshold. To enhance the performance of stations not meeting the benchmark response time, a comprehensive and detailed analysis of each underperforming station—indicated by a red bar—is crucial. This investigation should examine the frequency and timing of emergency calls to identify peak periods and potential staffing or resource shortages during those times. Additionally, FRD can investigate the physical location of the stations in relation to the areas they serve, considering natural and man-made barriers that might impede rapid response. FRD should ensure that newly converted ambulances are positioned to address current service gaps, prioritizing areas where response times consistently exceed the standard.
 

##	**Optimal Allocation 3 – Partition Approach** 
Figure 39 below represents average response time allocation under partition approach. Under this approach, the county was divided into ten sections, each analyzed for response times and incident rates. This method aimed to identify sections with high incident rates and above-average response times that lacked sufficient BLS coverage. The allocation of BLS units was then optimized based on this analysis to ensure better coverage and response times. In this graph, fewer red bars are present compared to those in figure 26, suggesting that this method resulted in a better alignment with the response time benchmark. When contrasting the results from the partition approach with those from the greedy algorithm, it is evident that the partition method significantly outperforms the latter. Only four stations are now recording response times above the benchmark with the partition approach, demonstrating a marked improvement in meeting the target response times.

The partition approach seems to be more effective as indicated by the reduced number of units exceeding the response time benchmark. The average response time under partition approach is 371.92 seconds which is an improvement from the 372.65 seconds under the greedy search algorithm allocation. The targeted strategy of the partition approach, which focuses on dividing the county into sections and analyzing specific needs, appears to have resulted in a more equitable distribution of resources. The granularity of the partition method allows for a more tailored response to the unique challenges of each section, potentially contributing to the improved performance over the greedy algorithm, which may not account for the variability across different geographic areas.

The provided histograms below in figure 29 offer a comprehensive comparison of Basic Life Support (BLS) response times before and after the implementation of a new allocation system using the partition approach. Before the new allocation, the distribution of response times exhibited a broader range with a longer tail, suggesting a higher frequency of longer response times. The mode was situated to the right of the benchmark line, indicating that the most common response time exceeded the desired benchmark.

After the new allocation, there was a noticeable tightening of the distribution, characterized by a steeper peak and shorter tails. Notably, the mode shifted to the left of the benchmark line, indicating that the most frequent response times now fell below the desired benchmark. The reduction in tails, particularly on the right side, signified a decrease in instances of excessively long response times. Analysis of these changes reveals a significant improvement in the average response time of BLS units.

The reduced variance in response times suggests a more consistent service, indicating that the partition approach has facilitated a more equitable allocation of BLS resources. The decrease in incidents with delayed response is particularly crucial in emergency medical situations where time is of the essence. This enhancement in the distribution implies that the partition approach effectively addressed factors contributing to longer response times, such as traffic patterns, geographic barriers, and incident rates. The tighter distribution not only indicates improved predictability in response times but also enhances the reliability of emergency services, thereby contributing to public trust and system resilience.
 
In summary, the post-allocation histogram demonstrates that the partition approach has led to a more efficient and effective distribution of BLS response times. The notable shift towards faster responses and the reduction in outliers highlight the success of this approach in enhancing overall emergency service delivery. In conclusion, the partition approach, with its methodical and localized analysis of BLS needs, appears to have outperformed the greedy algorithm in meeting the benchmark response times across Fairfax County. This suggests that a more nuanced method that accounts for specific regional demands can lead to better resource allocation and improved emergency response outcomes.
