# General History Timeline

The image depicts a timeline with various events related to emergency services. For 2021, there is a note about a paramedic shortage, illustrated with a picture of paramedics. In 2022, two events are noted: a change in units' allocation and their dispatch to cover incidents, and station collapse as a secondary effect, indicated by warning signs and images of a fire station and ambulance. The timeline points to 2023 with a note on a new dispatch to cover incidents, suggesting a response to the earlier challenges. The timeline uses icons and images to convey changes, issues, and current status within an emergency services context.

# Problem Statement 
## Problem Domain
![image](https://github.com/Xiaoqing15/DAEN-690-W_Insights/assets/137991044/1638672f-b7a1-43f8-bdd4-9b4c6f018a9f)

The image presents a schematic of challenges and changes in the emergency services domain. It identifies key challenges such as paramedic shortage, long call processing, extended response times, and units out of service. A central change is the implementation of a new dispatch algorithm. Additionally, there is a plan for the conversion of 8 Advanced Life Support (ALS) units to Basic Life Support (BLS) units. The problems addressed are the optimization of resource distribution, maximizing resource utilization to reduce response times, and understanding the effects of these changes on call processing, response times, and the community.

## Problem Statement 

In this project, we will need to evaluate and address challenges within emergency services, focusing on the effectiveness of 12 ambulances and the need for eight more to meet emergency demand. We'll analyze the impact of these additions on the community and how new dispatch algorithms, introduced in August 2023, improve call processing and response times. The FCFRD plans to convert eight medics to ambulances to optimize EMS resource deployment and maintain operational efficiency. We'll then have to examine the dispatch of response units for 46 types of EMS incidents, ensuring strategic paramedic distribution across Fairfax County. Addressing extended call processing times is crucial, particularly with Fairfax County's diverse languages necessitating translation services. The goal is a 6-minute, 30-second response time, with a paramedic on ALS emergencies for better patient outcomes.

Conclude the project by tackle the challenge of units being out of service to optimize resource allocation and readiness.

##	Problem Understanding

The Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department (FRD) sends out medical transport vehicles manned by both BLS and ALS personnel. Currently, 39 fire stations are home to 12 BLS transport units (ambulances) and 31 ALS transport units (medics). Early in August, new dispatch algorithms went into effect, changing how resources are sent to certain EMS (emergency medical service) occurrences. The FRD is thinking of converting eight more medics to ambulances in a way that strikes a compromise between delivering the best available personnel to various emergency situations, maintaining benchmark response times, and keeping resilience by promptly putting units back into operation.

# Project Goals
## Primary Goals
1. Evaluate whether the existing 12 ambulances are optimally assigned.
2. Determine where an additional eight ambulances should be converted (which fire stations).
3. Estimate the impact to the community and the FRD of converting an additional medics to ambulances.
4. Analyze the impact of dispatch algorithm changes on call processing and response time.

## Project Deliverables

1. Project deliverables will provide actionable insights for improving Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Departmentâ€™s resource allocation and response. A tool for simulating different response scenarios will be created to assess the impact of varying factors on emergency services.
2. Deliverables include an analysis of emergency data and a simulation model. This model will allow testing of different resource and response strategies to understand their effects on service efficiency.
