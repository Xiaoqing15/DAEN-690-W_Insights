##Abstract

This project focuses on optimizing the deployment of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department (FCFRD). With new dispatch algorithms launched in August 2023, the project's objectives are to assess the current distribution of 12 ambulances, plan the strategic placement of eight additional ambulances, estimate the effects of these enhancements on both community service levels and FCFRD operations, and analyze the changes in call processing and response times due to the new algorithms. The project employs three key sections: The first employs predictive analysis using a greedy algorithm to guide the conversion and optimal placement of ambulances. The second section, impact evaluation, scrutinizes the effects of dispatch algorithm modifications on operational performance and community outcomes. The final section leverages Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to forecast response times, enabling more precise resource allocation. The DNNs utilize a comprehensive dataset to learn from incident features and, through a refined process of adjusting weights and activation functions, yield accurate response time predictions. Performance metrics such as R Squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) evaluate the model's accuracy. In summary, this initiative advances EMS resource allocation and enhances response time accuracy in Fairfax County. By implementing advanced data-driven techniques and DNNs, the project significantly improves EMS resource distribution, minimizes response times, and ultimately elevates the efficiency and effectiveness of EMS services for the betterment of the Fairfax community welfare and safety.
