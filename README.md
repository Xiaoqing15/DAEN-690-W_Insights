## Description of our project
With the implementation of a new dispatch algorithms, the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department (FRD) is in need of optimizing the deployment of its emergency medical service (EMS) resources, including 12 ambulances and 31 medics running across 39 fire stations. Based on this scenario, the FRD is considering the conversion of eight medics to ambulances to ensure timely and suitable medical aid while maintaining response time standards and operational efficiency. The project aims to evaluate rationality of current distribution of ambulances, identify the optimal fire stations for conversion, estimate the implication of such conversions on community and FRD, and analyze the effectiveness of the new dispatch algorithms. By exploring these questions, FRD is able to find a balance between resource allocation, response time benchmarks, and operational resilience to provide efficient and effective emergency medical services to the community.

To address the diverse user stories that were presented, the system incorporated a modular architecture, ensuring agility and scalability. The architecture was built around a central data processing and ML moduling, interconnected with data sources and a Machine Learning Model. Data from emergency calls and historical incident reports were continuously ingested into the system. After pre-processing, it was used to train and evaluate the ML model and populate the visualizations. In our initial client meeting, we laid out our approach, ensuring they had a clear understanding of our strategy and the technological avenues we were exploring. Their feedback was invaluable, providing a practical perspective that we, as developers, might overlook. In a follow-up meeting, we showcased our preliminary results, giving them a tangible sense of our progress and the potential of our solution. Feedback loops were established to refine the model with real-world outcomes. Initial algorithmic approaches encompassed supervised learning models such as DNNs for dispatching and Greedy Heuristics for allocating. Their suitability was assessed based on the accuracy, 90 percentile and regression scores. Further, Hopper cluster analysis was performed to use it in future.
