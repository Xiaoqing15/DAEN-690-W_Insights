## Description of our project
With the implementation of a new dispatch algorithms, the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department (FRD) is in need of optimizing the deployment of its emergency medical service (EMS) resources, including 12 ambulances and 31 medics running across 39 fire stations. Based on this scenario, the FRD is considering the conversion of eight medics to ambulances to ensure timely and suitable medical aid while maintaining response time standards and operational efficiency. The project aims to evaluate rationality of current distribution of ambulances, identify the optimal fire stations for conversion, estimate the implication of such conversions on community and FRD, and analyze the effectiveness of the new dispatch algorithms. By exploring these questions, FRD is able to find a balance between resource allocation, response time benchmarks, and operational resilience to provide efficient and effective emergency medical services to the community.
